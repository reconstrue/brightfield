        "\n",
        "This notebook just does initial data analysis; it does not generate ML-based reconstructions. This notebook is written as if a data scientist without domain knowledge of the physics of brightfield microscopy nor neuroscience were given the Challenge data raw (i.e. just 2.5 TB of image files and SWC files in a bucket) and needed to get at least an overview of the data, before subsequently performing the main data analysis, which in the case of the Challenge is to generate SWC files for those neurons in the dataset that do not already have SWCs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In performing this initial data visualization exercise, we will recapitulate various microscopy imaging techniques, on Colab. The data viz number crunching happens on Colab. Additionally, the resulting data and images are viewed within the notebook on Colab (web tech on a web page). This is all just Python in Jupyter, tuned for deployment on Colab.\n",

        "### Data cache and workspace\n",
        "The data workspace is a directory on the Colab VM's file system wherein all files produced by this notebook are stored. That includes file produced by downloading the challenge dataset to a VM-local cache. In code, the workspace is referred to by a variable `data_dir` which by default is set to `/content/brightfield_data/`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to maintain the data workspace, there is a Librarian class, a singleton object that manages source and built files. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Rationale\n",
        "Organizing the data_dir this way has multiple benefits:\n",
        "- The dataset is too big (2.5 TB) so download specimens separately\n",
        "- Caching bypassed unneccesary repeat downloads\n",
        "- Multiple notebooks on Colab can all use the same data workspace cache **TODO:** orly? VM between notebooks?\n",
        "- The files in data_dir provide a static website for the full dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "About that last point: by repeatedly running this notebook for each specimen, the files in `data_dir` can be loaded into a static web server (the simplest kind of web server) and viewed in a web browser. So, this notebook produces various visualizations and the files in data_dir is the content for a web altas of the specimens contain the produced visualizations. In other words, those file do not require Jupyter to be viewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workspace file system structure\n",
        "The data workspace is organized within a single directory, the `data_dir`. Normally, `data_dir` is set to \"/content/brightfield_data/.\" So, from the root of the file system:\n",
        "\n",
        "```    \n",
        "- /content/\n",
        "  - brightfield_data/ \n",
        "    - dataset_cache/\n",
        "    - built/\n",
        "```    \n",
        "\n",
        "`data_dir` has a sub-directory, `dataset_cache`, which is the download cache of files from the dataset in Wasabi. The directory structure on Wasabi is mirrored in `dataset_cache`. The files are write protected to suggest they should not be modified after initial download/creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `built/` directory is where all generated files are parked by this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `built` directory's childern are all directories, which have names set to the specimen_id whose data is contained within each directory. (In other words, specimens in `TEST_DATA_DIR` are pulled up to root in `built`; all are treated the same in the web catalog.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the above file system layout, artifacts from multiple specimens can coexist on the local file system simultaneously without overwriting each other. In other words this code is designed to do multiple runs of single specimens and not have files overwriting each other."
