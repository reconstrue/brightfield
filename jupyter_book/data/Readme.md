# data directory

This directory contains one file `allen_institute_challenge_manifest.json` which
was generated by the code in `content/dataset_manifest.ipynb`. This manifest
need only be generated once, since the contents of the challenge repository do
not change over the period of the challenge. As such `dataset_manifest.ipynb`
has been run and its generated output cached here.

Arguably, a derived artifact does not belong in a source
repository. But since the Colab VMs do not share state across pages,
the only way to not crawl the 2.5 terabyte repo every time is to cache a
pre-generated `allen_institute_challenge_manifest.json` somewhere. That
somewhere is currently
[allen_institute_challenge_manifest.json](http://reconstrue.com/projects/brightfield_neurons/challenge_dataset/specimens_manifest.json),
which gets HTTP fetched from Colab in, e.g., `initial_dataset_visualization.ipynb`.
