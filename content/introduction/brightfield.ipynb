        "The topic of this project is imaging individual neurons stained with biocytin and imaged using a brightfield microscope. Defintions of those terms can be found in [Neuronal Morphology goes Digital: A Research Hub for Cellular and System Neuroscience](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3653619/) (2013)\n",

        "> **Biocytin and Biotinamide (Neurobiotin)**   \n",
        "> Biocytin is a small conjugate of biotin and lysine naturally found in eukaryotic organisms. Due to its low molecular weight and biocompatibility, it constitutes a valuable tool in whole-cell or juxtacellular recordings, as it is incorporated into living neurons without perturbing ionic balance or membrane properties. Biocytin stains both axons and dendrites and is not transported trans-neuronally... Both biocytin and biotinamide have high affinity for avidin, and the tissue is processed post-fixation using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex followed by DAB reaction...\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Bright field microscopy**   \n",
        "> The majority of dendritic and axonal morphologyreconstructions to date are based on bright field microscopy (Halavi et al., 2012), due to its broad compatibility with histological staining methods. In conventional bright field microscopy, as the name suggests, the tissue background is illuminated by transmitted light, whereas the stained neuron absorbs the light and is visible in dark contrast against the bright background. However, for certain applications or depending on user preference, simple image processing can be employed to invert this contrast (Myatt et al., 2012). Thus this modality should be more precisely referred to as trans-illumination or transmitted light microscopy. Unlike confocal microscopy, which requires fluorescent labels, bright field microscopy can visualize Golgi stain preparations and intracellular labels like biocytin. Even neurons labeled with fluorescent markers can be permanently labeled by DAB reaction and imaged with bright field microscopy. Moreover, the ability to enhance the signal intensity by counterstaining renders bright field microscopy largely unsurpassed for reconstructions of whole axonal arbors up to the very thin (and typically faint) terminals."

        "A silly analogy would be to think of a biocytin stained neuron as if it were a tourist atop an open-topped bus (read: a microscope's stage onto which a glass slide specimen is mounted). The bus is driving straight at a security CCD (the microscope's camers). The camera takes a series of photos of the neuron as it it driven though the camera's field of view (read: the stage is moved along the optical axis). As can be seen in the image sampling, much of the image stack is very blurry at the ends because all of the neuron is out of focus.\n",

The bluriness increases smoothly throughout the stack as the foreground object (a biocytin-stained neuron) moves through the scopes field of view. This is an artifact of the stained specimen on the glass slide moving throught the microscope's stationary field of focus.\n",
        "\n",
        "In brightfield microscopy, to get a 3D stack of images the specimen is not serially sectioned (think: deli meat slicer, which is not the case with brighfield). Rather the intack slab of brain is passed through the optical field of focus of the microscope. The stage that the glass slice is mounted on is moved along the Z-axis of the microscope. The 3D \"scanning\" is a series of photos as the specimen is moved.\n",
