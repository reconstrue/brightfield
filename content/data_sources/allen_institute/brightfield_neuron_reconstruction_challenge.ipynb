Neuron object recognition in brightfield microscopy is an open problem, currently necessitating many hours of manual neurite tracing (think: PhDs spending all day using a glorified Etch A Sketch).

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Brightfield Auto-Reconstruction Challenge, the Allen Institute assembled a dataset containing 115 cells for use in an evalution competition. The dataset is about 2.5 terabytes in size, consisting of raw brightfield microscopy image stacks produced by the Allen Institute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also includes SWC files for 105 of those 115 cells. These SWCs contain neuron skeletons manually traced by human experts. These stick figures are the labels for the trainging data – the so called gold standards i.e. the best answers as manually generated by human experts involving many hours of tedious data entry a.k.a neurite tracing. \n",
    "\n",
    "That works out to a roughly 90%/10% split of the datase into train and test subsets. The challenge is to generate SWCs for the ten cells in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents the code for multiple methods of neuron reconstruction including ShuTu and U-Net, two methods used in the original Challenge at BioImage 2019. Current research is exploring ResNet and Flood-filling Networks (FFNs) techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step with any dataset is exploratory data analysis and visualization. For a hands-on visual exploration of one cell's data, see the notebook [initial_dataset_visualization.cell_651806289.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVoQ1sKxzcpIlDx-TISCLbSadxpETIf6).\n",

    "### Target audience\n",
    "This project uses the Brightfield Challenge dataset to train models for brightfield neuron skeletonization, which can subsequently be used in production. Both training and inference are computed on Colab, for free. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target audience has two parts:\n",
    "- Computer vision researchers building object recognizer (read: training)\n",
    "- Lab scientists processing raw brightfield z-stacks into SWC files (read: inference)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first audience is the computer vision software developers. This project provides Jupyter notebooks that perform data ETL, manifesting, and triaging. These notebooks perform set up and grunt data wrangling for using the dataset for training. Additionally, ample visualization tools are provided specific to the nature of data. These tools enables a developer to quickly get to the interesting part, with the tools to introspect the models and their output. For example, these notebooks: \n",
    "1. Access and download the dataset\n",
    "2. Process the data to generate SWC skeleton files\n",
    "3. Juxtapose new reconstruction SWCs alongside manual gold standard SWCs\n",
    "\n",
    "The second audience is the sole researcher with a raw image stack off of a microscope desiring to produce a SWC, as well as other visualization. This person doesn't want to train neural networks, they simply wish to upload their images and run software (with pre-trained ML models) that will make an SWC file and related renderings. This is the inference phase.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of auto-reconstruction is to automate neurite tracing, traditionally performed manually. The following image is taken from [the challenge's home page on alleninstitute.org](https://alleninstitute.org/events-training/bioimage-informatics-2019/reconstruction-competition/). It illustrates the objective of this exercise: the input is grayscale microscope images of an individual neuron; the output is a 3D stick figure of the neuron. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this image there are three examples, each in a separate column. The pairs of images consist of one grayscale camera image (a projection of the input) and one corresponding skeleton (the output) rendered in neon color on a dark field.\n",

    "### Brightfield modality\n",
    "\n",
    ">The majority of dendritic and axonal morphology reconstructions to date are based on bright-field microscopy (Halavi et al., 2012), due to its broad compatibility with histological staining methods...\n",
    ">Moreover, the ability to enhance the signal intensity by counterstaining renders bright-field microscopy largely unsurpassed for reconstructions of whole axonal arbors up to the very thin (and typically faint) terminals. [[Parekh and Ascoli, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3653619/)]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [brightfield microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright-field_microscopy), a single neuron is pumped full of biocytin to stain its insides black, while the rest of the specimen's brain tissue is chemically cleared to be translucent. In other words, there is a single dark/opaque foreground object – a biocytin stained neuron, the object of interest – which is imaged upon some essentially translucent background (or \"field\"). The field is bright (because of light shining through it) and the foreground is more opaque and so appears dark, ergo \"brigthfield.\"\n",

    "### Reconstruction: an unsolved problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Brightfield neuron reconsturction is an open image processing problem, and a rate limiting factor in brightfield microscopy. Currently, brightfield neuron reconstruction involves manual labor comprising many hours of manually tracing skeletons from the raw brightfield image stacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brightfield microscopes are the simplest and most common type of microscope, so solving this problem could enable many labs to perform image analysis more quickly. This means that brightfield reconstruction software is more widely used, compared to other microscopy modalities. Brightfield is a relatively low tech microscopy modality that produces great results.\n",

    "From the computer vision perspective, [natural intelligence object recognition may be based on skeletons](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-bones-about-it-people-recognize-objects-by-visualizing-their-skeletons/) so this problem for neuroscience may feedback to the artificial intelligence community, specifically the visual object recongition folks. Recurrent networks are a promising candidate for this mode of microscopy data.\n",
