    "# AllenSDK on Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../images/647289876.minip_colored_turbo.tif.cropped.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://www.alleninstitute.org/) (Allen Institute) maintains an SDK, called [`the Allen SDK`](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK), for working with their resources ([data](http://portal.brain-map.org/) and services). This notebook, [`allensdk_on_colab.ipynb`](https://github.com/JohnTigue/colab-utils/blob/master/tools/allensdk_on_colab.ipynb), is focused on nothing except the installation of the Allen SDK on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following snippets were tested on Colab in new notebooks, for both options available on Colab: Python 2 and Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herein, `AllenSDK` and `allensdk` refer to the Python package that gets imported, which is distinct from \"the Allen SDK\" which is `AllenSDK` plus further documentation, example code, etcetera that can be found in [the Allen Instutute's repository](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "This notebook was built out while working through – on Colab – the Allen Institute's pedagogical Jupyter notebooks in both the Allen SDK and their [Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Allen SDK documentation includes example Jupyter notebooks for [how to use `AllenSDK`](https://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/examples.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Separately, the Allen Institute holds an annual two week retreat, the Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain (SWDB), where they train up promising new neuroscientist on how to do science with the Allen Institute's data and tools. The main pedagogical medium in AllenSDK and SWDB repos is Jupyter notebooks, which can be found on GitHub, [AllenInstitute/AllenSDK](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK/blob/master/doc_template/examples.rst) and [AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SWDB notebooks assume that [`AllenSDK` is preinstalled](http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/install.html#installation-with-docker-optional). That is, in order to get an arbitrary, as-found-on-GitHub SWDB notebook to work in Colab, a `!pip install allensdk` is required first.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Colab, a single user is provided a single virtual machine (VM) which has a file system. Both the VM and it's file system are transient, with a maximum lifetime of 12 hours (supposedly) but they can get killed off in as little as 60 minutes due to being idle (the only persistant info is the notebook itself, stored on Google Drive not the local file system). But for the lifetime of a given VM, the AllenSDK only need be installed once, after which any notebook can `import allensdk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: in Colab both Python 2 and Python 3 notebooks can be run. Installing `allensdk` in a Python 2 notebook does not make `import allensdk` work in a Python 3 notebook on the same Colab VM, and vice versa.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file makes it trivial to repeat (and debug) `AllenSDK` installs as needed – which can be rather frequent on Colab. The `pip install` is just one line of code; the real value here is this text and the collection of debug tools that can come in handy if set-up does not going well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install This File as Colab Custom Snippets\n",
    "This notebook reads well enough as one sequential story but the text is really designed to read well as individual snippets, in Colab's code snippet insert dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"install\" these snippets in your Colab snippets library:\n",
    "* Load this file in Colab\n",
    "* Copy the URL (~`https://colab.research.google.com/...`)\n",
    "* In any Colab page, from the menus select `Tools=>Preferences...` \n",
    "* In `Custom snippet notebook URL`, paste the URL\n",
    "* Press `Save`\n",
    "* Reload\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Colab does allow for multiple simultaneous `Custom snippet notebook URLs`... sometimes and sometimes not.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the above set-up, it's trivial to insert cells that install and test `AllenSDK`.  For example, load in Colab a SWDB notebook, say [`BrainObservatory.ipynb`](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018/blob/master/DynamicBrain/BrainObservatory.ipynb), then simply select `Insert => Code snippet...` and search for `allensdk` and the following come up:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnTigue/colab-ing/master/images/allensdk_snippets_in_colab.png\" width = \"300px\" alt=\"AllenSDK snippets in Colab sidebar\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Select `Install AllenSDK` and run the resulting code cell, after which the Allen notebooks should work on Colab. Your modification will not persist in the GitHub hosted repo's copy of BrainObservatory.ipynb (i.e. the notebook is in playground mode). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ergo, these snippets provide a relatively easy way to play with the Allen pedogogical notebooks on Colab, short of forking the original repo... which is one of the things Colab is really useful for."
