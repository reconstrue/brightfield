For example, there is a 2018 pre-print[<sup>1<sip>](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06955.pdf) which seems promising. The recurrent aspect allows the model to maintain an internal memory/state about remote areas of a given neuron. Neurons are very, very long compared to other cells. The recurrence can span such distances. In the pre-print recurrent U-Net is applied to retinas.\n"
